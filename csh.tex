\begin{abstract} This paper aims to help with the development of new models of homotopy type theory, in particular with models that are based on realizability toposes. For this purpose it develops an internal simplicial homotopy that does not rely on the \emph{small object argument} or \emph{minimal fibrations} as these require structure that realizability toposes lack.\end{abstract}

Three papers:
-simplicial homotopy
-complete categories [how they are preserved]
-the realizability model of HOTT [how to get a fibrant object out of a category]

Idee: reverse the order. definitions--theorem--lemmas. That way the purpose of the lemmas is set up from the start.

\section*{Introduction}
This paper grew out of an attempt to build a \emph{recursive realizability} model for \emph{homotopy type theory} following the example of \citep{KLV12}. The intention is to interpret types as the homotopy types of certain simplicial objects in the \emph{effective topos}. This category lacks some of the structure of the category of sets underlying classical homotopy theory. In the internal logic the principle of the excluded middle and the axiom of choice are false. The category of assemblies is not exact and lacks infinite limits and colimits. While there are \emph{generic monomorphisms} there are no subobject classifiers. We work around these issues in the following way.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Limit the class of cofibrations. In classical simplicial homotopy theory every mono\-morphism is a cofibration. We demand that certain properties of the monomorphisms are decidable so classical arguments remain valid.
\item Strengthen the lifting property. Fibrations come equipped with a \emph{filler operator} that gives solutions for a family of generic lifting problems.
\item Build the homotopy category out of fibrant objects only. That way we avoid needing fibrant replacements.
\end{enumerate}
To avoid distracting peculiarities of the realizability categories this paper works with a generic \emph{$\Pi$-pretopos} with a \emph{natural number object}. 

\subsection*{Conclusion} There are definitions of fibrations, cofibrations and their acyclic counterparts (definitions \ref{model structure}) in $\Pi$-pretoposes that make the category of Kan complexes a \emph{model category} (theorem \ref{model category}). Certain \emph{universal fibrations} (definition \ref{universal modest fibration}) automatically live in the category of Kan complexes (theorem \ref{fibrant universe}).

\subsection*{Related literature}
Simplicial homotopy is the homotopy of simplicial sets. It is equivalent to the homotopy of CW complexes which are a category of topological spaces \citep{Hovey99,GJSHT}. The intended model was the \emph{ex/lex completion} \citep{MR1600009} of category of assemblies defined in \citep{MR1097022,MR2479466,MR1023803}. This completion is not the famous \emph{effective topos}, but it is another realizability topos.
