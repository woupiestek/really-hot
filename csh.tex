\begin{abstract} This paper develops the foundations of a constructive simplicial homotopy, that takes the logical limits of the internal languages of realizability toposes in account. The aim is to help the development of new models of homotopy type theory, in particular models that are based on simplicial objects of realizability toposes and related categories. \end{abstract}

Three papers:
-simplicial homotopy
-complete categories [how they are preserved]
-the realizability model of HOTT [how to get a fibrant object out of a category]

Idea: reverse the order. definitions--theorem--lemmas. That way the purpose of the lemmas is set up from the start.

\section*{Introduction}
This paper grew out of an attempt to build a \emph{recursive realizability} model for \emph{homotopy type theory} following the example of \citep{KLV12}. The idea was simply to do simplicial homotopy (see \citep{Hovey99,GJSHT}) in a \emph{realizability topos} (see \citep{MR2479466}). 
What makes this challenging is that realizability toposes may lack infinite limits and colimits and that the internal logic does not always satisfy the principle of the excluded middle and the axiom of choice. We face these challenges with the following tactics.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Limit the class of cofibrations. In classical simplicial homotopy theory every mono\-morphism is a cofibration. We demand that certain properties of the monomorphisms are decidable so classical arguments remain valid.
\item Strengthen the lifting property. Fibrations come equipped with a \emph{filler operator} that gives solutions for a family of basic lifting problems.
\item Build the homotopy category out of fibrant objects only, so we don't need fibrant replacements.
\end{enumerate}
To avoid distracting peculiarities of realizability toposes, and to underline that the proofs are predicative as well as constructive, this paper works with a generic \emph{$\Pi$-pretopos} (see definition \ref{pretopos}) with a \emph{natural number object}.

\subsection*{Intended model} The \emph{category of assemblies}, which is the category of $\neg\neg$-separated objects of the effective topos up to equivalence, has several \emph{strongly} complete internal categories that are not posets, in particular the \emph{category of modest sets} \citep{MR1097022,MR2479466,MR1023803}. \emph{Strongly complete} means that the externalization of the internal category is a complete fibred category. The category of assemblies is not exact, but the \emph{ex/lex completion} \citep{MR1600009} preserves strongly complete internal categories. This exact completion is not the effective topos, but it is a kind of realizability topos and it is the intended ambient category $\ambient$ in this paper. 

The topos with a complete internal category that is not a poset is interesting, because complete internal categories in Grothendieck toposes are necessarily posets. This fact is traditionally attributed to Peter Freyd.

In the ex/lex completion \emph{modest fibrations} are fibrations whose underlying morphisms are families of modest sets or quotients of such families by modest families of equivalence relations--see \citep{MR1097022,MR1023803,MR2479466}. There is a \emph{universal modest fibration} (see definition \ref{universal modest fibration}) which is a \emph{univalent fibration} and hence a potential model of homotopy type theory.

\subsection*{Conclusion} There are definitions of fibrations, cofibrations and their acyclic counterparts (definition \ref{model structure}) in $\Pi$-pretoposes that make the category of Kan complexes a \emph{model category} (theorem \ref{model category}). Certain \emph{universal fibrations} (definition \ref{universal modest fibration}) automatically live in the category of Kan complexes (theorem \ref{fibrant universe}).
