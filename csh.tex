\begin{abstract} The paper show how to develop simplicial homotopy inside realizability categories like the category of assemblies, where the small object argument and minimal fibrations are unavailable. This way simplicial assemblies are a suitable model for homotopy type theory.\end{abstract}

Three papers:
-simplicial homotopy
-complete categories [how they are preserved]
-the realizability model of HOTT [how to get a fibrant object out of a category]

Idee: reverse the order. definitions--theorem--lemmas. That way the purpose of the lemmas is set up from the start.

\section*{Introduction}
This paper grew out of an attempt to build a \emph{recursive realizability} model for \emph{homotopy type theory} following the example of \citep{KLV12}. The intention is to interpret types as the homotopy types of the simplicial objects in the \emph{category of assemblies}. What makes this challenging, is that this category lacks some of the structure of the category of sets that \emph{classical homotopy theory} is build on. In the internal logic the principle of the excluded middle and the axiom of choice are false. The category of assemblies is not exact and lacks infinite limits and colimits. While there are \emph{generic monomorphisms}, they are not subobject classifiers. I offer the following solutions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take the exact completion of the category of assemblies. This is not the effective topos but another realizability topos.
\item Limit the class of cofibrations. In classical simplicial homotopy theory every mono\-morphism is a cofibration. We demand that certain properties of the monomorphisms are decidable.
\item Strengthen the lifting property. Fibrations come equipped with a \emph{filler operator} that specifies a solution for each of the basic lifting problems.
\item Build the homotopy category out of fibrant objects only. This way we don't need the infinite colimits that make the small object argument of classical simplicial homotopy work.
\end{enumerate}
To avoid the distracting peculiarities of the category of assemblies and its exact completion this paper works with a generic \emph{$\Pi$-pretopos} with a \emph{natural number object} instead of the category of assemblies itself.

The paper works out suitable definition of fibrations, cofibrations and their acyclic counterparts (definitions \ref{model structure}) and proves that they form a model structure on the category of Kan complexes (theorem \ref{model category}). The last section confirms that certain universal fibrations actually live in the category of Kan complexes (theorem \ref{fibrant universe}). 

\subsection*{Related literature}
Simplicial homotopy is the homotopy of simplicial sets. It is equivalent to the homotopy of CW complexes which are a category of topological spaces \citep{Hovey99,GJSHT}. The intended model is the \emph{ex/lex completion} \citep{MR1600009} of category of assemblies defined in \citep{MR1097022,MR1023803,MR2479466}. This completion is not the famous \emph{effective topos}, but it is another realizability topos.
