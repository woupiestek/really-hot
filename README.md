version control for 'realizability of univalence'

This repository contains the latex files for a paper I am writing about homotopy theory in certain realizability toposes. 
Simplicial objects in the exact completion of the category of assemblies could be an interesting as a model of homotopy type 
theory -- see: homotopytypetheory.org. This requires redeveloping a part of homotopy theory in a constructive way, which is what 
I am struggling to do here.
